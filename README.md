# jquery infinitescroll

A demo page is currently [here](http://infinitescroll.zedler.it/demo/page1.html)



## Usage

```
<script src="<some_path>/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="<some_path>/jquery.infinitescroll.js"></script>
<script>
    $('.row').infinitescroll({
        itemSelector: '.col',
        nextSelector: '.next-page',
        bufferPx: 40,
    });
</script>
```

An Ajax call takes place when the first element matching the
`nextSelector` comes closer to the window bottom than the pixels
defined in `bufferPx` during scrolling.

The Ajax call fetches that page which is defined in the `href` of the
first link matching `nextSelector`.

The elements of the fetched page matching `itemSelector` are appended
to the jQuery collection.

If the next page has an element matching `nextSelector` as well,
the whole procedure repeats.
